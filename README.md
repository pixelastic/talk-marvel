# Super-powers with API

In this talk I explain what APIs are, and how you can (and should) use them to
build websites and apps.

## TODO

When talking about web scrapping, using Captain Hammer "A man gotta do what
a man gotta do"

When talking about bash scripts "Sometimes you gotta bash in heads"

When talking about best practices "With great power comes great
responsibilities"

About having a great dataset, but a poor API on top:
"It is not who I am, but what I do that defines me". Batman

Each API does ont thing and one thing only. But it is the sum of all those that
makes a project successful. Just like a super hero team.
